;; Exercise 2.6

;; In case representing pairs as procedures wasn't mind-boggling enough, consider that, in a languag that can manipulate procedures, we can get by without numbers(at least insofar as nonnegative integers are concerned) by implementing 0 and the operation of adding 1 as
;; This representation is know as church numerals, after its inventor, Alonzo Church the logician who invented the Î» calculus.
;; Define one and two directly(not in terms of zero and add-1)
